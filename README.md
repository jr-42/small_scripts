# Small Scripts
A slowly growing collection of small scripts and projects mostly in Python.
Will either be small things just to improve my Python skills or bits of code that I find useful.


## Installation
The smaller scripts just have a requirements file so, after creating a python env, install the dependencies with :  

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

The larger scripts will have a setup.py file so, again, after creating a python env, install using :  

```pip install .```


## Current Scripts 

### Pool Finder
A script for detecting swimming pools from aerial photos.

### Evolutionary Fitness
Two algorithms for mimicking sexual and asexual reproduction. A 'starter' sentence 'evolves' towards a target sentence.

### Avalance Model
A simple 1 dimensionnal sandpile model 

### Python Code Snippets
A collection of small and useful python code snippets to use in other projects
